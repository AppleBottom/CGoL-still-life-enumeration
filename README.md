# CGoL-still-life-enumeration

These files contain partial lists of still lifes[1] in Conway's Game of
Life[2].  They were computed using Simeks's GoL still life searcher[3] as
part of an ongoing effort to count and enumerate still lives of populations
n >= 24.  For more information, see the relevant thread[4] on the
ConwayLife.com forums.

Note: the data files were compressed using xz(1), and will expand to about
15 to 20 size their compressed size.
